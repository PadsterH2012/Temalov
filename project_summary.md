- AI Integration: OpenAI GPT or similar models

## Project Setup

To create this project from scratch, you would need to:

1. Set up the project structure with separate directories for each microservice
2. Create Docker configurations for each service
3. Implement the Flask applications for the API, Content Creator, and Web Frontend
4. Set up the PostgreSQL database and create the necessary tables
5. Implement user authentication and authorization
6. Integrate AI models for content generation
7. Develop the web interface
8. Set up API endpoints for CRUD operations
9. Implement PDF parsing functionality
10. Create unit tests for each component
11. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins
12. Configure Docker Compose for local development and testing

## Development Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL
- Flask and related extensions (Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, etc.)
- AI model integration (e.g., OpenAI API)
- PDF parsing library (e.g., PyPDF2)
- Testing framework (e.g., pytest)
- Frontend libraries (e.g., Bootstrap)

## Deployment

The project is designed to be deployed using Docker containers. Each microservice has its own Dockerfile, and the entire application can be orchestrated using Docker Compose.

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests should be implemented for each component of the system. The test suite can be run using pytest and should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time collaboration features
2. Advanced AI-powered content generation
3. Integration with popular RPG platforms
4. Mobile application
5. Expanded game mechanics and rule systems
